# DOM Playground

## Instructions
Fix the page design and layout by modifying the DOM. When complete, your page should look like the original, "[Wicked Grove](http://www.csszengarden.com/006/)" design.

You'll need to look for the comments found in the `index.html` file. Follow the instructions in each comment, but do not modify the HTML or CSS file. All modifications must be done in JavaScript. Use the `js/fix-the-page.js` file for your DOM modifications. 

## Rules
1) You may not modify the HTML file.
2) You may not modify the CSS file.

You can use the original HTML and CSS files for reference.
