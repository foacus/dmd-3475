# Tip Calculator
An exercise in JavaScript function definitions and return values. Course: DMD 3475. 

## Introduction
Our tip calculator application is almost complete. Our function named `updateValues()` will fetch the values that were input by the user. 

At that point, the values are passed as arguments to two functions named `calculateTipPerPerson()` and `calculateTotalPerPerson()`. The values that are returned by each function are used to update the DOM.

## Instructions

1. Define both required functions: `calculateTipPerPerson()` and `calculateTotalPerPerson()`.
2. Each function should accept the 3 arguments being passed to them within the `updateValues()` function.
3. Using those values, calculate and return the appropriate answer.
4. Extra credit: Properly round the dollars and cents that are returned by your functions.

## Helpful Information
* Search Google for "Tip Calculator" to see the desired functionality for this application.
* The `calculateTotalPerPerson()` function should return a value that includes the tip.
